Welcome to foobar version 1-326-g8328491-beta (2020-06-19T17:25:05.164691)

Google has a code challenge ready for you.
Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

Warning! Your invitation may expire if you leave this page. Sign in to save progress and resume later.
